## How To

You need to:

1. get Azure DevOps licenses for your developers;
2. create an Azure DevOps project in an appropriate organization 
   where you will conduct your development;
3. get access to the `CICDTemplateSamples` project, which
   contains a lot of samples, instructions, pipelines, templates 
   to help your onboarding.

Ask Ram to help you with.


## Get Started

1. Login to Azure DevOps
2. Choose the `CICDTemplateSamples` in our organization (you'll
   have no doubt guessing its name).
3. Inspect and follow instructions in the `0-readme-first` 
   repository.

## Disclaimers

We only support:

1. cloud Azure DevOps;
2. YAML Azure DevOps pipelines; look for Classic pipelines support 
   elsewhere.
