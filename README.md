## How To

You need to:

1. get Azure DevOps licenses for your developers;
2. create an Azure DevOps project in an appropriate organization 
   where you will conduct your development;
3. get access to the `CICDTemplateSamples` project, which
   contains a lot of samples, instructions, pipelines, templates 
   to help your onboarding.

Ask Ram to help you with.
