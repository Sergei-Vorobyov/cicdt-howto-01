## You Need To (Prerequisites):

1. get Azure DevOps licenses for your developers;
2. create an Azure DevOps project in our title organization, or 
   in an appropriate other organization; you will conduct all your 
   development in this project;
3. get access to the `CICDTemplateSamples` project in our title
   organization, which contains a lot of samples, instructions, 
   pipelines, templates to help your onboarding.

Ask Ram to help you with.


## How to Get Started:

1. Login to Azure DevOps.
2. Choose the `CICDTemplateSamples` in our title organization.
3. Inspect and follow instructions in the `0-read-me-first`

## Disclaimers

We only support:

2. YAML Azure DevOps pipelines.

Look for on-prem Azure DevOps and Classic pipelines support elsewhere.
